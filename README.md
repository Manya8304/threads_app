# Threads App Clone

Welcome to Threads App Clone! This project utilizes a modern tech stack to create a robust and scalable web application.

The goal of creating this clone is to provide a practical example for learning and understanding Next.js while replicating the functionality and design of the Threads app.
 
In this clone, I added features of the original Threads App and introduced user-friendly modifications, like "communites" for different users to interact with like-minded people.

## Tech Stack

### Client-Side
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive designs.
- **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and more.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.

### Server-Side
- **Next.js:** Used for server-side logic, including API routes and server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript:** Enhances type safety and consistency in server-side code.

### Database
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database providing flexibility and scalability.
