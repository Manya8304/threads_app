**Threads App Clone**
The goal of creating this clone is to provide a practical example for learning and understanding Next.js while replicating the functionality and design of the Threads app. In this clone, I added features of the original Threads App and introduced user-friendly modifications, like "communites" for different users to interact with like-minded people.

**Tech Stack**
